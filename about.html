    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my site, where I would love to share what is in my TBR, book review, and also current reading books!</p>
<p> The type of books that I usually go for would be <i>murder mystery</i> genre, however, it's not limited to it, as you would be able to see the range from my tbr/current read/book review</p>
<p> Apart from English novels, I do read Japanese novels, danmei/BL novels/manga/manhua/manhwa, translated novels from Korean...</p>
