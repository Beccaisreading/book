<h2>What You Are Looking For Is in the Library</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Michiko Aoyama</p>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> 2020</p>

      <h3>⭐ Review</h3>
      <p><bold>Rating</bold>: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>There are 5 short stories for this book, and I love each of the story and how they manage to find what they need each time.</p>

<p>Imagine if we could have someone like Mrs Sayuri Komachi in our life, a librarian that have an appearance like Baymax, Michelin mascot, or mochi, based on the description given by the characters in the story. The sentence uttered by her to the people who came to the library, “What are you looking for?” Makes the rest of the people feel like uttering their heart content, not only for books, but what they are dreaming of/feeling lost at. And how she could give one of the book recommendations (out of the one that they are looking for) + the felting mascot as a bonus gift with the book.</p>

<p>And once they read the recommended book + seeing the felting mascot given, they are able to interpret what they are looking for in their life.</p>

<p>Sharing my favorites quotes in this book:</p>
<p>“Everybody is connected. And any one of their connections could be the start of a network that branches in many directions. If you wait for the right time to make connections, it might never happen, but if you show your face around, talk to people and see enough to give you the confidence that things could work out, then “one day” might turn into “tomorrow”.”</p>

<p>“Books will always be essential for some people. And bookshops are a place for those people to discover the books that will become important to them.”
